## Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
OOP is an important topics this days, So, This repo is for writing important notes about this topic for future usage.
This topic is mainly from 2 courses, One from Udemy [csharp-intermediate-classes-interfaces-and-oop](https://www.udemy.com/course/csharp-intermediate-classes-interfaces-and-oop/),
and the other from Pluralsight [Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals in C#](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/object-oriented-programming-fundamentals-csharp/table-of-contents).

#### Let's Start :point_down:

### Principles of OOP:

- **Encapsulation:** It's about hiding data and  implementation details.
- **Abstraction:** It's about hiding unnecessary implementation details.
- **Inheritance:** It's about relationships and subclasses between objects, allowing developers to reuse a common logic while still maintaining a unique hierarchy.
- **Polymorphism:** Objects can take on more than one form depending on the context. The program will determine which meaning or usage is necessary for each execution of that object, cutting down the need to duplicate code.
